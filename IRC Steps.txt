First: we needed to grab a Raspberry Pi from the ETR bin, and download the OS, then save it on an SD card. 
This was a painful and tedious process that had to rely on the school's network speed.


Second: after the OS has successfully downloaded, we boot the Raspberry PI off the SD card that contains it's 
OS. Now we have a fully fuctional Raspberry Pi. We get started with installing and setting up our Raspberry 
Pi IRC Server we will first run an update and upgrade to ensure our Raspberry Pi is completely up to date.
In the command console type:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade


Third: now that the Raspberry Pi now up to date we can proceed with installing the IRC Server software onto it.
We are using a piece of software called Ircd-Hybrid. To install the software, type the following command into 
the command console:

sudo apt-get install ircd-hybrid


Fourth: we need to set up a password and OPing for the server. In the command console type:

/usr/bin/mkpasswd password


Fifth: we will need to edit the ircd.conf file within the /etc/ircd-hybrid folder. Once this line is found, type
in the following:

sudo nano /etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf


Sixth: there are MANY various options. We need to find and edit these lines:

in the serverinfo { block find
name = "hybrid8.debian.local";

replace this with whatever you are naming your IRC server.

name = "SplashingAround.irc";

next find
description = "ircd-hybrid 8.1-debian";

rename it

description = "Raspberry Pi IRC Server";
This sets the servers description and will be what people see when they connect to your server.

next find
network_name = "debian";
network_desc = "This is My Network";

replace these lines with your own names and descriptions

network_name = "SplashingAround";
network_desc = "This is my Raspberry Pi IRC Network";


then find
max_clients = 512;

replace that with

max_clients = 128;
This defines the maximum amount of people that can be connected to the IRC Server.

Then we neeed to find the operator { block
Find and remove
"#" (The pound signs)
if you see ## only remove the first one.

next find
name = "sheep";

replace this with whatever you want to name the OP's

name = "op"; (I named mine "pimps"

then find
user = "*@192.0.2.240/28";

replace this with

user = "*@*";
This will change it so that anyone connecting to the server can run the oper command. If you want to restrict 
this to local users only you can try using something like “*@192.168.*.*“.

Then we find the password settings
password = "xxxxxxxxxxxxx";

replace this with whatever password you created earlier for encryption
password = "REPLACE WITH YOUR ENCRYPTED PASSWORD";


Seventh: save your configuration progress save and exit.
Ctrl X, then press Y

Eighth: you need to restart the server in order for your changes to take effect. In the command console type:

sudo /etc/init.d/ircd-hybrid restart


Ninth: you need to have an IRC client on whatever computer you are working with, or whichever one you are using
to test connection to your IRC server.

I downloaded Pidgin from the Ubuntu App store. This was simply by typing in "Pidgin," and hitting download.

Tenth: once inside your IRC client, select "Add Server". You will need to know your server's IP address, and 
password.

AMAZING! You have now set up a server and can chat with people who actually use such programs!



Eleventh: After that you want to make sure other PCs can connect as well. Get on to another person's machine\
