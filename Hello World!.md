# How to install Pycharm and Create a Basic "Hello World" Scrpit


Since I was using Ubuntu 16.04, installing PyCharm was fairly easy. Just goto the Ubuntu Software Center.

Once there, Search "PyCharm"

Alternatively you can use the command terminal:

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mystic-mirage/pycharm`



##### Now that Pycharm is installed we can create a basic script.

Open up your PyCharm application and start a new project.

Type `print("Hello World")`

Easy right? Once you're done click: "File -> Save As" and name it something simple. In this example I used "hello.py". Don't forget ".py" must be included.

You can press **F5** to run the script, or run it from the command terminal:

`$ python hello.py`

The terminal will then display the message you created.
